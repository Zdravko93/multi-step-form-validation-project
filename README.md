## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-step form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

written in a more convenient manner

-Gained valuable experience in estimating project time
-Sharpened my JavaScript skills/ideas for better code refactor, maintanability,
and sticking to DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) concept.
