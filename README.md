# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This project is a dynamic and user-friendly multi-step form validation system designed to enhance user experience through step-by-step data input with real-time validation feedback. It ensures that users provide valid and accurate information before submitting the form. The project demonstrates my ability to build interactive, front-end web applications with a focus on usability, validation, and clear user interaction.

### Features

- Multi-Step Form: The form is divided into multiple steps to improve user experience by guiding them through the process
- Real-Time Validation: Each input field is validated in real-time to provide immediate feedback and ensure that only valid data is submitted
- Progress Indicator: A visual indicator shows the userâ€™s progress through the form, making it easier to understand how many steps remain
- Responsive Design: The form is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- Error Handling: Clear and concise error messages help the user understand what needs to be corrected before proceeding

### Tech Stack

- HTML5: Structure and content of the form.
- CSS3: Styling the form and making it responsive across devices.
- JavaScript: Implementing the logic for multi-step navigation and form validation.
